#Og is the leader of the surprisingly mathematically advanced, though technologically run-of-the-mill, Calm Waters cave
#man tribe. He must decide on the number of stone clubs and stone axes to be produced for the upcoming battle against the neighboring
#Peaceful Sunset tribe. Experience has taught him that each club is 
#good for, on the average, 0.45 kills and 0.65 maims, while each axe 
#produces 0.70 kills and 0.35 maims. Production of a club requires 
#5.1 lb of stone and 2.1 man-hours of labor while an axe requires 3.2 lb 
#of stone and 4.3 man-hours of labor. Ogâ€™s tribe has 240 lb of stone 
#available for weapons production, and a total of 200 man-hours of 
#labor available before the expected time of this battle (that Og is sure 
#will end war for all time). Og values a kill as worth two maims in 
#quantifying the damage infl icted on the enemy, and he wishes to 
#produce that mix of weapons that will maximize damage.
 #(a) Formulate this as a linear programming problem. Make sure to define your decision variables.
 #(b) Represent this problem graphically, making sure to identify all the feasible corner points and the infeasible corner points.
 #(c) Solve the problem graphically.
 #(d) Solve the problem using the computer.
